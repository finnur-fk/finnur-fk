## 🚀 14. Nóvember Milestone: The Awakening
Þetta repo markar upphafið að nýju tímabili. Við höfum tekið 11 ára reynslu úr "Net-Tester" umhverfinu og umbreytt henni í **The Master Key** fyrir fjárhagslegt uppgjör og audit-trail.

### 🛡️ Core Infrastructure
* **Vault System:** Lokuð hvelfing fyrir viðkvæm gögn (PayPal/Bank).
* **Grade Blocker:** Sjálfvirk gæðavörsla sem hleypir engu í gegnum PR nema A+.
* **Copilot Agent:** AI-stýrð vélstjórn sem vinnur 24/7.

### 📈 Current Mission
1. Sameina alla 11 ára söguna í einn Master Ledger.
2. Keyra 603+ færslur í gegnum `check_transactions.go`.
3. Tryggja fullkomna persónuvernd (Privacy by Design).
